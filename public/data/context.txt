This is a website for resume verification using blockchain technology.During the initial identity verification process, individuals provide the necessary documents to verify specific attributes (e.g. resume verification).These documents are then verified and the verification status, along with relevant attributes, is securely stored in a blockchain network. This status confirms the authenticity and validity of the documents without disclosing their full content. When a third party needs to verify the validity of an individual's document, they can access the blockchain network to check the verification status. The third party does not require access to the entire document; but only the confirmation regarding its validity through the blockchain record. This minimises the exposure of sensitive personal information. Individuals have the autonomy to grant or deny  access to their verified documents for specific third parties. This access control mechanism ensures that individuals maintain control over their personal information and decide who can access it.Third parties can trust the system because the blockchain's immutability ensures that the verification status recorded at the time of initial verification remains accurate and unchanged. The integrity of the blockchain record provides a reliable source for third parties to verify identities without relying on the potentially insecure transmission or storage of personal data.
